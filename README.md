# Cyber and Fraud Centre Scotland - IPSplitter 
This is a useful tool for internal vulnerability assessments and splitting up the IP range(s) that you are conducting your scans on. It will output the files and may leave remainders in a seperate file for further sorting. Please check before running the `NetScan.sh` script. 

## Usage
The tool take zero command line arguments but will require you to input the IP addresses once the script is running. The necessary command is `./ipsplit.sh`.
